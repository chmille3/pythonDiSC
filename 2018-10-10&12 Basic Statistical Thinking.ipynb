    "**What does statistical thinking look like and how do I interpret statistical output in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*The goal of today's class is to better understand the difference between simplistic data-driven thinking and statistical thinking. In a nutshell, the type of statistics I mean here are meant to help answer the questions \"Is it real?\" or \"Does it matter?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Suppose the top two students in a class have a 98.1% semester grade and a 98.2% semester grade respectively. Which one is the better student? Simplistic data-driven thinking says student 1 is better because they have a higher grade. But any number of factors could have produced the difference, from the timing of assignments for other classes to the relative weighting of skills associated with each student's strengths. Few people would argue that Student 1 is conclusively a stronger student.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Statistics provide a mathematically-informed way to make such decisions. In today's lesson, we'll test the likely range of population means of scores, had other similar students had the same assignment, and whether students who like N Sync are actually more successful in their assignments than those that prefer Backstreet Boys.*"

If p is less than 0.05, we say there is a statistically significant difference between the groups; e.g. they're not random samples drawn from the same population. Remember there is still a 1 in 20 probability that you're wrong, but if the test value p is decreased, we then increase the probability of not finding a difference even when there is a true difference.\n",

More cases provide more degrees of freedom, which allows for more statistical confidence even with the same differences in means.
